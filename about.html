            <p>I am an experienced acupuncturist, herbalist, and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner. I specialize in chronic pain relief, injury treatment, weight management, womenâ€™s issues, and alleviation of stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.</p>
            <p>In Beijing and Hangzhou, China, I worked in clinics alongside some of the top Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors in the country. I have extensive training in CranioSacral Therapy, which is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of the CranioSacral system. I am also licensed as a certified massage therapist (CMT), and can incorporate tuina, polarity, and acupressure massage modalities into a treatment program for my patients.</p>
            <p>On a more personal level, I love sports, and used to play basketball, volleyball, tennis, and ran track and field. I have had chronic knee pain, shoulder injuries, tennis elbow, wrist sprains, ankle injuries and many other sports related injuries. My daughter played competitive junior tennis and collegiate tennis and has suffered many injuries throughout her career, all of which I have treated.</p>
            <p>Due to my extensive experience with both my personal injuries and my daughter's injuries, I not only understand the situations of my patients, but can also relate to them and have always tried my best to resolve their problems so that they can get back to their sports/exercises as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>I also have chronic pains, including 4th degree degenerative knee pain on both knees, and lower back pain caused by a spondylolisthesis issue between L3 and L4. I have managed all my pains without any surgery and am able to live a regular life and perform intense work on my patients as needed. Thankfully, due to my personal treatment, I am also able to practice Bikram Yoga everyday.</p>
            <p>I like problem solving and I do not give up easily in searching for answers and solutions. My philosophy as a health practitioner is to always try to provide my patients with the best mental and physical support to the best of my abilities based on all of my knowledge and techniques.</p>  
            <p>One of my passions is to use my knowledge and understanding of each patient's respective needs and apply that knowledge effectively in order to bring happiness and better health to them. My treatments are professional and effective, and I work well with patients of all ages. I pride myself in making my practice a quiet, relaxing, and comfortable place for my patients. Thank you.</p>
