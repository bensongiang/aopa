              <h2 id="chinese-acupuncture">What is Chinese Acupuncture?</h2>
              <p>Chinese acupuncture is one of the main forms of treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. It involves the use of sharp, thin needless that are inserted in the body at very specific points. This process adjusts and alters the bodyâ€™s energy flow (Qi) into healthier patterns, and is used to treat a wide variety of illnesses, injuries, and health conditions.</p>

            <div class="faq-entry">
              <h2 id="herbal-remedies">What are Herbal Remedies?</h2>
              <p>Chinese herbal medicine is based on an individualized pattern diagnosis as well as disease diagnosis. A patient receives a custom written formula to treat the symptoms, the disease, and also their individual pattern. The specific pattern is made up of signs and symptoms as well as a person's emotional well-being, and body constitution. The two most common methods of herb therapies are a decoction (a strong tea that must be simmered for about an hour or more) and large honey-bound pills. </p>

              <h2 id="craniosacral">What is CranioSacral Therapy?</h2>
              <p>CranioSacral Therapy (CST) is a gentle, hands-on approach that releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole-body health and performance. Using a soft touch which is generally no greater than 5 grams, about the weight of a nickel, practitioners release restrictions in the soft tissues that surround the central nervous system. By normalizing the environment around the brain and spinal cord and enhancing the body's ability to self-correct, CranioSacral Therapy is able to alleviate a wide variety of dysfunctions, from chronic pain and sports injuries to stroke and neurological impairment.</p>

              <h2 id="accupressure">What is Acupressure?</h2>
              <p>The application of pressure (as with the thumbs or fingertips) to the same discrete points on the body stimulated in acupuncture that is used for its therapeutic effects (as the relief of tension or pain). Acupressure massage performed by a therapist can be very effective both as prevention and as treatment for many health conditions, including headaches, general aches and pains, colds and flu, arthritis, allergies, asthma, nervous tension, menstrual cramps, sinus problems, sprains, tennis-elbow, and toothaches, another others.</p>

              <h2 id="cupping">What is Cupping?</h2>
              <p>Cupping therapy is an ancient form of Chinese medicine in which a therapist puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction. People get it for many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage. The cupping method of creating a vacuum on the patient's skin to dispel stagnation (stagnant blood and lymph) improves the qi (energy) flow in a patient and can treat respiratory diseases such as the common cold, pneumonia and bronchitis, among other health issues.</p>

            <div class="faq-entry">
              <h2 id="ear-seeds">What are Ear Seeds?</h2>
              <p>In this form of traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, a practitioner places the tiny seeds of the vaccaria plant on key points on the ear and tapes them in place. Pressing on the seeds stimulates the related point. The ear hosts acupressure points that correspond to each part of the body. When you stimulate a point, the smooth and abundant flow of qi or vital life energy returns the related organ or area, allowing healing to take place. Ear seeds can be used alone or in combination with acupuncture or body acupressure in order to treat a host of symptoms, and can offer gentle support for your weight loss or smoking cessation efforts, or to help you fight addictions.</p>

              <h2 id="tuina">What is Tui Na?</h2>
              <p>This Chinese therapy makes use of rhythmic compression techniques along different energy channels of the body to establish harmonious flow of Qi throughout the body and bringing it back to balance. The main benefit of Tui Na massage is that it focuses on the specific problem, whether it is an acute or a chronic pain associated with the joints, muscles or a skeletal system. This technique is very beneficial in reducing the pain of neck, shoulders, hips, back, arms, highs, legs and ankle disorders. It is a very effective therapy for arthritis, pain, sciatica and muscle spasms. Other benefits include alleviation of the stress related disorders like insomnia, constipation, headaches and other disorders related to digestive, respiratory and reproductive systems. Anyone who wants to avoid the side effects of drugs or a chemical based treatment can adopt this effective massage technique to alleviate their pain.</p>

              <h2 id="polarity">What is Polarity?</h2>
              <p>Polarity therapy is a four-part approach to balancing the energetic patterns of the body. It combines bodywork, nutrition, stretching postures, exercise, and attitudinal counseling to free energy blockages and establish a natural energy flow for healing. Polarity is intended to restore a balanced distribution of the body's energy and allows the body to develop stronger self-healing capabilities.</p>

              <h2 id="moxibustion">What is Moxibustion?</h2>
              <p>Moxibustion is a form of heat therapy in which dried plant materials called "moxa" are burned on or very near the surface of the skin. The intention is to warm and invigorate the flow of Qi (energy) in the body and dispel certain pathogenic influences. It involves the burning of mugwort, a small, spongy herb, to facilitate healing. That herb, mugwort, is compressed into a slim cylinder that looks like a big cigar and held close to the skin after being lit. The heat generated can be used to warm specific sections or the meridian points of the body so that blood and Qi (energy) circulate more freely.</p>

              <h2 id="qigong">What is Qigong?</h2>
              <p>Qigong is a meditative technique in which breathing patterns are coordinated with body postures and movement. Part of traditional Chinese medicine, qigong directs the flow of "energy fields" vital to the body. Qi is Chinese for breath and energy, and the technique marshals such techniques as deep breathing, concentration, and relaxation to help restore and maintain proper energy balance to the body. Qigong can be used as a therapeutic intervention, but is also considered a good preventative health option.</p>

              <h2 id="gua-sha">What is Gua Sha?</h2>
              <p>Gua Sha is a traditional healing technique, in which repeated pressurized strokes over lubricated skin using a round-edged instrument are applied. The application of the strokes causes small red or purple spots to appear on the skin; these fade after two or three days. The technique is most commonly used to treat fever, heat exhaustion, asthma, muscle and tendon injuries, poor blood circulation, headaches, and other minor problems.</p>
